    <h1>Privacy & Trust</h1>
    <p class="trust-subtitle">
      ATSPro is designed for job seekers who care about both opportunities and privacy.
      Here’s exactly how we handle your data — in simple language.
    </p>

    <!-- BIG PROMISE -->
    <section class="trust-card">
      <h2>Our Core Promise</h2>
      <p class="trust-highlight">
        🔒 <strong>We do NOT store or sell your resume, ever.</strong>
      </p>
      <ul class="pill-list">
        <li>✅ No account or login required to use ATSPro.</li>
        <li>✅ Your resume is only used temporarily to calculate the score.</li>
        <li>✅ We do not train any models on your personal resume data.</li>
        <li>✅ You can close the page and your data is gone from our system.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- HOW THE SCORING WORKS -->
    <section class="trust-card">
      <h2>How the ATS Score Works</h2>
      <div class="trust-grid">
        <div>
          <h3>1. Structure (30 points)</h3>
          <p>
            We check if your resume has the key sections most ATS and recruiters expect:
            Summary, Skills, Experience, and Education.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>2. Formatting (20 points)</h3>
          <p>
            We flag things that commonly break ATS systems: tables, images, fancy fonts,
            headers/footers, multi-column layouts, and scanned PDFs.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>3. Keywords (50 points)</h3>
          <p>
            When you paste a job description, we compare its keywords with your resume
            and score how closely they match (with more weight for real skills & tools).
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>4. Writing Quality (30 points)</h3>
          <p>
            We look for action verbs, achievements with numbers, weak phrases, repetition,
            and heavy passive voice to help you sound more impactful.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="trust-note">
        🧠 <strong>Important:</strong> ATSPro gives an estimate based on common ATS rules.
        Every company’s ATS is different — use this as a guide, not as a guarantee.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- GEMINI / AI TRANSPARENCY -->
    <section class="trust-card">
      <h2>How We Use AI (Gemini)</h2>
      <p>
        ATSPro uses Google’s Gemini model <em>only</em> when you click the AI buttons
        (Improve Summary, Rewrite Bullet, etc.).
      </p>
      <ul class="pill-list">
        <li>✨ Your text is sent securely to Gemini’s API for rewriting or suggestions.</li>
        <li>✨ The responses you see come directly from the AI model.</li>
        <li>✨ We don’t secretly send your entire resume anywhere without your action.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="trust-note">
        You’re always in control — you choose what text to send to AI, and you can edit
        or ignore any suggestion.
      </p>

    <!-- BEST PRACTICES -->
    <section class="trust-card">
      <h2>Best Practices for Safe Use</h2>
      <ul class="pill-list">
        <li>🔹 Avoid uploading government ID numbers or highly sensitive information.</li>
        <li>🔹 Use a job-search email instead of your primary personal email.</li>
        <li>🔹 Always review AI suggestions and make sure they are accurate and truthful.</li>
      </ul>
